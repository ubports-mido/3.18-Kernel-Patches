Subject: [PATCH 05/10] UBUNTU: SAUCE: Revert: fix: only allow a single
 threaded process to ...

Revert the enforcement of only a single thread tasks using change_onexec.
While this change prevents applications from using change_onexec in
a potentially broken way (it can be done right but the application code
using it needs to be carefully audited), it does restrict historically
allowed behavior. Specifically this change is causes docker to fail, and
needs to be reverted until it can be selectively applied with policy
changes.
